***A Dart library to interact with Sharkey, a Mastodon alternative. :shark: :dart:***

## ABOUT :books:

This library for Dart is there to interact with Sharkey from Dart or Flutter. This library is supposed to be used for writing apps with Flutter.

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

### Adding to your project

To add ***Sharkey.dart*** to your project's dependencies, add these lines to your project's `pubspec.yml`:

```YAML
dependencies:
  ...
  sharkey: ^0.1.0
```

The three dots represent anything else that you might have in the `dependencies` section.
Having done that, re-fetch your project's dependencies by running this in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ dart pub get
```
